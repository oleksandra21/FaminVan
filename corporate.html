          <ul>
            <li>
              For the colour scheme of FamVan we used the following colors:&nbsp; &nbsp;
<ul class="list-unstyled">
           	<li> <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #EEE4CF;"> </span> #EEE4CF&nbsp;</li>

<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Font choices&nbsp;</strong></li>
           <div class="pacifico-regular">
  <h1 class="text-style1 larger-text">Pacifico Regular</h1>
</div>
            <li> We choose 3 fonts for our brand. Since our brand is for families with younger children and the website is about games, films, and music, we wanted our fonts to be playful. That is why we used Pacifico Regular for our titles. The joyful and friendly font type of the handwritten style adds approachability to our brand. Our intention is for the font to create a sense of relaxation among users. </li>
<br>

<li>For our subheadings we decided to go with the font Concert One regular. We think that this font is perfect for subheadings because it is more professional, and its sharp edges make it very readable.&nbsp;</li>
<br>
	<div class="montserrat-famvan">
  <h5>Montserrat Regular</h5>
</div>		  
<li>For our regular text we use Montserrat Regular. This font is readable on screens which we think is very important for our regular text. Even though that it is a formal font it feels less formal than other fonts like, Times New Roman, Calibri or Futura. As a result, we maintain the playful mood we aim for. </li>

			  <li><strong>User interface patterns:</strong> (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>
			  The Home page:
		 <br> 
           <br>
			  The Movies page:
		  <br> 
			  On the movie page we decided to go for several colons next to each other. We chose this because you can see a lot more films briefly. This makes this page clear and easy to use.  
		   <br>
			  <br> 
			  The Playlists page:
			  <br>
			  For the playlist page we wanted to add a lot of playlists, but we didn’t want to make this page messy. Our solution was using carousels.

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Our marketing campaign is promoting FamVan, a camper van brand, to the target audience of 35-50-year-olds living in the Netherlands, particularly couples with children   who are adventurous, active, and prefer experiences over luxury. The message of the campaign centres around the idea of family bonding and adventure, stimulating quality family time and making the journey more enjoyable for everyone. In addition, the campaign highlights the inclusion of games while travelling to keep children entertained and engaged during the trip. The promotional activities executed include consistent posting of engaging content - reels on Instagram and engaging posts (destination spotlights, travel tips, and daily interactive stories) and active participation in relevant Facebook groups, along with targeted advertising to reach our target audience effectively. The campaign aims to reach 100 users on both Instagram and Facebook, gain 100 followers on each platform, and increase audience engagement and page followers through organic reach and engaging content.</p>

              <p><em>&nbsp; </em><br>
Jaap is very adventurous, flexible and, sporty. That is why a camper van is the perfect vehicle for him. Because he is so active and adventurous he finds having a daily routine uninspiring and he craves variety and excitement in his day-to-day activities. When he and his family go on a trip with it, they usually don’t stay somewhere for longer than 3 days because he likes to be on the road and explore as many places as possible. He enjoys the time on the road because the whole family sings along with the radio and they make up fun games to do together in the camper van. Jaap also loves to hike and do photography on his destinations. Jaap is fluent in English and very social which makes it easy for him to connect with people on the way. He likes to share a selection of his nicest photos from his camper van trips on Instagram in a slideshow because he enjoys sharing his adventures with his friends, family and colleges. He also likes to share all the places that he discovers for his job. He uses Instagram for this because he thinks this is the easiest way to share it with everyone in one time and he likes to have all his nice pictures in one place. Jaap is also a real Burgundian. He loves good food and wines and beers. This is something he is very enthusiastic about while being in different countries. That’s why he loves to try all the different supermarkets in other countries when he travels. He is an extravert who gets energy from being around friends and family so when he is not working during the weekends he loves to invite friends. On these days he likes to cook for them and spend long nights talking preferably with a good class of wine or beer. Jaap finds it frustrating when his children are on their phones all day. He thinks it is important that they occasionally play a game together or play outside. He also finds it annoying if his family prefers to stay in one place for many days. He enjoys being on the road and explore a lot of destinations. He wants to take advantage of the four weeks that the summer camper vacation normally lasts for.</p>
				  
				  	Reach – We want to reach 100 users on Instagram and 100 users on Facebook. 
					Popularize FamVan by gaining 100 followers on both Instagram and Facebook on our brand pages within one month, achieved organically through engaging content. 
					Affect – Make the target audience feel inspired to take on new adventures and meet fellow camper van owners to share their passion on the road. 
					Create Instagram and Facebook content that inspires our target audience to take on new family adventures and enjoy memorable moments on the road, making them feel cozy, excited, and connected, measured by increased engagement metrics and positive feedback from followers. 
					Response – Interact with the content and follow the page. 
					Increase audience engagement by 130% and gain a 1900% growth in page followers for our camper van pages between week 1 and week 4 of regular posting through engaging content and organic reach. 
<h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>	  
				  <p> <strong> What did you learn during the duration of the project concerning the campaign?</strong> <br>
We learned that through consistent posting and a well-made content planning it is possible to attract organically an audience towards your brand. In total we shared 25 posts on Instagram and 21 on Facebook and had a reach of 1026 Instagram accounts and 350 Facebook profiles. 
					  <br>
					  <br>
					  Thorough initial research of our competitors’ profiles is an important step for a successful content planning. We used online tools to access statistics about their Instagram content insights and learned from their rights and wrongs – reels attract more engagement than posts, a consistent feed balanced with frequent posting helps growth, some hashtags are more successful than others, following trends boosts posts. 
					  <br>
					  <br>
					  Even though content generated with colourful templates and illustrations attracted an audience on Instagram, Facebook users preferred real-life authentic posts, which unfortunately we were not able to create at this point ourselves. Stock images of families we shared, accompanied by a poem in the caption were among our most successful posts with the first one getting 123 Reach, 13 Engagement and second getting 35 Reach, 9 Engagement. Videos based on Instagram Reels trends also weren’t popular with our audience and stories got 0 Engagement. .</p>
				  
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>If the campaign was about to continue for the next 2-3 months, we would:
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  Share with our followers insights about the actual platform we have been developing and officially release it to be in use - As the concept behind our website is simple – provide entertainment of various kinds to families on the road, suitable for all age groups, we did our best to make the platform fully functional. Therefore, if we share it with our social media audience (which is the same demographic as the one intended for the website) we will provide them with more value and make them more loyal to the brand. This would be also a great opportunity to gather feedback and polish the product to their liking. 
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  Create UGC through social media challenges – As gradually we began gathering bigger audience surrounding our brand and tracked increase in the engagement with stories (from 0 views in day 1 to 17 views during the last week), we would love to engage even further by involving them in online challenges and stimulate them to share their travel memories, tips, or participate in challenges and record specific task with their families. This would lead to stronger community and increase in the organic reach. 
			  <br>
			  <br>
			  Collaborate with real camper van travellers and share their personal stories – to establish a deeper bond with our audience, it would be also beneficial to put out more personal content that would trigger stronger emotional connection. A better developed platform with a released product has the potential to attract better and bigger collaborators who would retain the interest of our followers. Keep the regular posting on Instagram and increase Facebook presence – a better tailored Facebook content based on more thorough research would help this channel grow as well.</p>
          <p> <br>
            <br>
            What worked and what didn’t?  
            <br>
			  <br>	  
            We failed to reach both of our Reach and Response objectives, but Instagram reels proved the most successful type of content and maintained average plays of 130 with an average reach of 97 accounts, and average watch time of 5 seconds. In comparison carousel posts had an average reach of 44 accounts. 
            <br>
			  <br>
            We did a few more experimental posts but unfortunately, they were not as successful as we hoped: 
			  <br>
			  <br>
            We did a collaborative post on Instagram with another brand from our class Cares and Tails – providing dog sitting services while you are on the road. Contrary to our expectations that the algorithm would promote better the collaboration post, it was one of our least successful, reaching only 22 accounts, while our most successful one for comparison had reach of 216 accounts. 
			  <br>
			  <br>
            On Instagram we also created a reel about an exclusive movie checklist that our followers can access if they like, comment and reshare the post. Even though the video had 64 plays, no one followed the instructions. 
			  <br>
			  <br>
            We noticed that Camping photos accompanied by poems are more successful on Facebook, so we decided to create an online event scheduled for the 6th of April called “Camping Poetry Reading”, encouraging users to bring their favourite camping poems, or simply enjoy what the others have prepared to read. Unfortunately, no one signed up for the event. 
			  <br>
            <br>
            What went as expected and what didn’t?  
            <br>
			  <br>
             <strong> Week 1</strong> <br>
At the beginning of the planning, we did separate content plans for both platforms, where for Instagram we planned to post every day, and for Facebook to post once every three days. Every post we shared was accompanied by compelling caption, hashtags, and stories, for which we did another planning where every day had a designated theme. As our objective was to reach the audience organically, we thought that for Instagram a good strategy would be to follow accounts with similar interests, promoting the campervan lifestyle and interact with their posts. We For Facebook we thought that that could be done by joining Camper-related Facebook groups, as they are already established communities, sharing the same interests.  
            <br>
			  <br>
            <strong> Week 2 </strong><br>
In week 2, we found out that the Instagram strategy was successful as we already had 40 followers and some engagement. As expected, reels had more organic reach than posts, that’s why we kept posting mainly video content. Facebook on the other hand was lacking behind in content, so we thought that in order to have a more engaging page for the Facebook communities that may discover it, it may be a better idea to share as much content on it as possible, therefore we began reposting our Instagram content on Facebook as well.  
            <br>

            <strong> Week 3 </strong><br>
At the beginning of our third week of posting, we shared some of our photos and videos in 4-5 camper van related groups. Unfortunately, there was no engagement with them, and our followers were still at 0. Then we joined Facebook groups with broader audience – not only camper van owners, but more travellers in general. We also began experimenting with different types of content – videos, photo posts from templates, family photos with poems, text posts and even created an online event. Still the shared posts in the groups didn’t bring us as much page traction as expected. The most shared posts from us in groups had higher overall reach but our followers remained 0, meaning that the users didn’t find our style of posting engaging or we simply didn’t retain their attention for long enough to open the page and scroll through. Even though for Instagram stories we were following the themed days plan at first, soon we realised that much more engaging would be resharing the post of the day and other photos/videos within the same topic, ranging from Questionnaires, Polls, Facts, Bucket Lists to Movie Clips, Quizzes and more. In this way a more complete narrative was established, and stories views kept increasing.

            What would you do differently?
			  <br>
			  <br>
            Do better research on engaging Facebook content and algorithm – beforehand we were all better aware of the type of content that goes on Instagram and is preferred from users as we are active users there ourselves. Therefore, it is safe to say that we underestimated the research needed to become more aware of the ideal Facebook content also tailored for our target group. While we had experience in managing Instagram pages, we had never used the Meta Business Suite and Facebook Analytics.  All of that combined, we couldn’t manage to put equal effort for our Facebook posting compared to that on Instagram as it felt more distant and less relevant to us.

            Based on the fact that our most successful media were the reels, we could have tried to create a TikTok account and share them on there as well. The essence of our platform was entertainment provided for the whole family and we followed the strategy of gathering  
            ‘parent’ audience who would as result spread the word to their children. With separate research we could have found a way to reverse the process and promote it towards the children on TikTok, who could share it with their parents.</p>
