          <ul>
            <li>
              For the colour scheme of FamVan we used the following colors:&nbsp; &nbsp;
<ul class="list-unstyled">
           	<li> <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #EEE4CF;"> </span> #EEE4CF&nbsp;</li>
           	<li>&nbsp; <em>Off white signifies…</em></li>
            <li> <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #757B33;"> </span> #EE7622&nbsp;</li>
            <li><em>The green colour   . Green stands for…</em></li>
            <li> <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #273726;"> </span> #00406B&nbsp;</li>
            <li><em>The dark green signifies…</em></li>
            <li> <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #E38E26;"> </span> #00406B&nbsp;</li>
            <li><em>Orange signifies…</em></li>
            <li> <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #EB6425;"> </span> #EB6425&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li><em>The bright orange signifies…</em></li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Font choices&nbsp;</strong></li>
           <div class="pacifico-regular">
  <h1 class="text-style1 larger-text">Pacifico Regular</h1>
</div>
            <li> We choose 3 fonts for our brand. Since our brand is for families with younger children and the website is about games, films, and music, we wanted our fonts to be playful. That is why we used Pacifico Regular for our titles. The joyful and friendly font type of the handwritten style adds approachability to our brand. Our intention is for the font to create a sense of relaxation among users. </li>
<br>

<li>For our subheadings we decided to go with the font Concert One regular. We think that this font is perfect for subheadings because it is more professional, and its sharp edges make it very readable.&nbsp;</li>
<br>
	<div class="montserrat-famvan">
  <h5>Montserrat Regular</h5>
</div>		  
<li>For our regular text we use Montserrat Regular. This font is readable on screens which we think is very important for our regular text. Even though that it is a formal font it feels less formal than other fonts like, Times New Roman, Calibri or Futura. As a result, we maintain the playful mood we aim for. </li>
<br>
			  <li><strong>User interface patterns:</strong> (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>
			  The Home page:
		 <br> 
           <br>
			  The Movies page:
		  <br> 
			  On the movie page we decided to go for several colons next to each other. We chose this because you can see a lot more films briefly. This makes this page clear and easy to use.  
		   <br>
			  <br> 
			  The Playlists page:
			  <br>
			  For the playlist page we wanted to add a lot of playlists, but we didn’t want to make this page messy. Our solution was using carousels. 
		    <br>
			  <br>
		    The Games page:

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Our marketing campaign is promoting FamVan, a camper van brand, to the target audience of 35-50-year-olds living in the Netherlands, particularly couples with children   who are adventurous, active, and prefer experiences over luxury. The message of the campaign centres around the idea of family bonding and adventure, stimulating quality family time and making the journey more enjoyable for everyone. In addition, the campaign highlights the inclusion of games while travelling to keep children entertained and engaged during the trip. The promotional activities executed include consistent posting of engaging content - reels on Instagram and engaging posts (destination spotlights, travel tips, and daily interactive stories) and active participation in relevant Facebook groups, along with targeted advertising to reach our target audience effectively. The campaign aims to reach 100 users on both Instagram and Facebook, gain 100 followers on each platform, and increase audience engagement and page followers through organic reach and engaging content.</p>

              <p><em>Explain an stify the chosen channels/platforms used and show there is a solid connection to the objectives established in the Communication &amp; Media Plan.&nbsp; <br>
                    Jaap is very adventurous, flexible and, sporty. That is why a camper van is the perfect vehicle for him. Because he is so active and adventurous he finds having a daily routine uninspiring and he craves variety and excitement in his day-to-day activities. When he and his family go on a trip with it, they usually don’t stay somewhere for longer than 3 days because he likes to be on the road and explore as many places as possible. He enjoys the time on the road because the whole family sings along with the radio and they make up fun games to do together in the camper van. Jaap also loves to hike and do photography on his destinations. Jaap is fluent in English and very social which makes it easy for him to connect with people on the way. He likes to share a selection of his nicest photos from his camper van trips on Instagram in a slideshow because he enjoys sharing his adventures with his friends, family and colleges. He also likes to share all the places that he discovers for his job. He uses Instagram for this because he thinks this is the easiest way to share it with everyone in one time and he likes to have all his nice pictures in one place. Jaap is also a real Burgundian. He loves good food and wines and beers. This is something he is very enthusiastic about while being in different countries. That’s why he loves to try all the different supermarkets in other countries when he travels. He is an extravert who gets energy from being around friends and family so when he is not working during the weekends he loves to invite friends. On these days he likes to cook for them and spend long nights talking preferably with a good class of wine or beer. Jaap finds it frustrating when his children are on their phones all day. He thinks it is important that they occasionally play a game together or play outside. He also finds it annoying if his family prefers to stay in one place for many days. He enjoys being on the road and explore a lot of destinations. He wants to take advantage of the four weeks that the summer camper vacation normally lasts for. </em></p>
